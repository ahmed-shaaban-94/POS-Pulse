/**
 * POS v3.5 Slice 1 — AuditPlaceholder (thin "coming soon" pane).
 *
 * The Audit surface is a later display slice (a chronological, append-only
 * audit log of every accountable action — see prototype README §8). Until that
 * slice lands, the nav entry routes here to a thin placeholder so the 7-entry
 * rail is fully reachable without implying functionality.
 *
 * Navigation-only: no fetch, no IPC, no persistence, no audit-log read.
