/**
 * 011-sale-sync-capture-up T025 — `SaleSyncClient` DI seam.
 *
 * The engine depends ONLY on this interface. The concrete HTTP client
 * (`createSaleSyncClient`, T061) is BLOCKED on the backend deploy (#349); until
 * then the engine is driven against `createFakeSaleSyncClient`. When the live
 * client lands it implements this interface unchanged and the engine is unaffected.
 *
 * The fetch outcome is a typed union mirroring the HTTP responses the engine
 * acts on (contracts/README.md): `ok` (200/201), `duplicate` (409 — idempotent
 * success), `transient` (5xx / timeout — retry), `permanent` (4xx — dead-letter),
 * `no_connection` (offline / DNS / refused). `postSale` NEVER rejects — transport
 * faults are mapped to the union. The raw response body is NEVER surfaced (P7);
 * the operator token is attached main-process-side and never passed through here.
