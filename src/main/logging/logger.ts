/**
 * T060 — main-process logger.
 *
 * Wraps `pino` + `pino-roll` to produce JSON-per-line records under the
 * injected `logsDir`, rotated daily and retained for 14 days. Two
 * instances live in main: one tagged `process: 'main'` writing to
 * `main-YYYYMMDD.log`, one tagged `process: 'renderer'` writing to
 * `renderer-YYYYMMDD.log` (renderer logs flow over IPC; see
 * src/main/ipc/log.ts).
 *
 * SECURITY POLICY (Constitution VII + data-model.md § LogRecord):
 * Callers MUST NOT log secrets, tokens, plaintext credentials,
 * passwords, card data, PII, or any value retrieved from the
 * SecretStore. A redaction layer is deferred to a later feature; in
 * 001 enforcement is by code review.
 *
 * R9 mitigation: a `pinoRollFactory` is injectable so unit tests can
 * substitute a `PassThrough` stream and avoid touching the real
 * filesystem.
 *
 * R4 mitigation: if the rolling-stream factory throws (e.g.,
 * unwritable logs dir), we surface the error to console once and
 * return a degraded-but-functional pino instance writing to stderr,
 * so the app continues launching per spec.md:130.
