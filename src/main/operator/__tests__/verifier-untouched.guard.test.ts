/**
 * 019-cashier-pin-provisioning T024 — verifier-untouched guard (FR-8).
 *
 * The whole feature exists to move the cashier_pin_records identity key from
 * the provider-coupled Clerk subject to the provider-neutral `user_id`. That
 * is only safe BECAUSE the unlock-time verifier never keys on identity — it
 * reads the row's secret material (hash/salt) and lockout state, not *who* the
 * cashier is. A clerk-keyed row and a born-neutral row therefore verify
 * identically; 019 changes the key without touching the verifier.
 *
 * This guard is the structural proof of that premise. It fails if a future
 * change gives any verifier function an identity parameter — the tripwire that
 * would mean the verifier started caring about identity, breaking born-neutral.
 *
 * `Function.length` counts the parameters before the first default/rest arg,
 * so an added `cashierId` (or any identity arg) bumps it and trips this test.
