/**
 * T085 — 008 Slice 1b AD-7 sale-number allocator.
 *
 * Per spec §FR-010 + plan §AD-7 + data-model.md §"Entity: SaleNumberSequences"
 * + `visual-direction/README.md` (a) composition decision #4.
 *
 * Allocates the canonical sale-number string for a given
 * (terminal_id, terminal_label, local_calendar_day) tuple:
 *
 *   sale_number = `<terminal_label>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<NNNNNN>`
 *
 *   • `<terminal_label>` is embedded verbatim. The caller is responsible for
 *     having validated the label against `^[A-Z0-9-]{1,16}$` at terminal-
 *     pairing time (002). No runtime regex check here — trust internal
 *     code, validate at boundaries (Constitution + CLAUDE.md).
 *   • `<YYYY-MM-DD>` is passed in by the caller (AD-2 finalize derives it
 *     from the terminal's local timezone at finalize-commit time per R-7
 *     midnight-roll-boundary rule).
 *   • `<NNNNNN>` is the per-terminal per-day monotonic counter, zero-
 *     padded to 6 digits.
 *
 * **Caller contract:** the allocator MUST run inside an outer transaction
 * (the AD-2 atomic finalize transaction). The allocator does NOT open its
 * own BEGIN/COMMIT — that would break the rollback-safety guarantee
 * (see T043). SQLite's UPSERT semantics + the composite primary key on
 * (terminal_id, calendar_day_local) make the increment atomic within the
 * caller's transaction.
 *
 * Pattern mirrors `src/main/payments/repositories/payment-attempts.repository.ts`
 * (006 S3a T111) — narrow `DatabaseHandle` interface adapter; no business
 * logic beyond the UPSERT-and-increment + the format-string composition.

/**
 * Bind the allocator to a `DatabaseHandle`. Returns an object exposing

 * better-sqlite3 handle, tests bind to the sql.js adapter.
 *
 * The SQL flow is:
 *
 *   1. UPSERT-and-increment via `INSERT … ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE`.
 *      • Inserts (terminal_id, calendar_day_local, 1, now) if the row
 *        doesn't exist (next_sequence = 1 → first allocation issues
 *        sequence 1, then sets next_sequence to 2 in the same UPSERT).
 *      • Updates next_sequence = next_sequence + 1 if the row already
 *        exists.
 *   2. RETURNING captures the post-write next_sequence value.
 *   3. The allocated number is `next_sequence - 1` (the value that was
 *      effectively "just used"; what's left in the table is the NEXT
 *      value to allocate).
 *
 * SQLite's transaction-level isolation guarantees atomicity within the
 * outer transaction the caller has opened.
