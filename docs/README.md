## Visual system

The README uses GitHub-renderable SVG and Mermaid:

- SVG assets provide a polished product-grade first impression. The architecture and system-flow diagrams animate inline on GitHub via SMIL.
- Mermaid keeps technical flow diagrams editable in Markdown.
- Icons live under [`assets/icons/`](assets/icons/) and use a consistent terminal-oriented enterprise style with depth gradients, soft shadows, and subtle motion.

## Documentation rules

- Keep wording truthful to the POS terminal scope.
- Do not imply this repository owns the SaaS backend or dashboard.
- Preserve the secure Electron process boundary in any architecture docs.
- Treat the hardware matrix and constitution as higher authority than marketing language.
