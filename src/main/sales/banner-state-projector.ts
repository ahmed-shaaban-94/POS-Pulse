/**
 * Banner-state projector (008 follow-up slice — sales.subscribe banner_state).
 *
 * Computes the current terminal's `BannerState` for the renderer's persistent
 * banner. Snapshot-style (mirrors 005/006 `subscribe ≡ read`): the renderer
 * polls this on an interval; no push channel.
 *
 * PER-SALE rule (coordination §S3c projection rule — load-bearing against
 * silent failure, PRODUCT.md Principle 3): a sale is in `printer_failure` iff
 * ITS OWN latest print event is `outcome='failure'`. A newer sale's success
 * must NOT clear an older sale's unresolved failure. The terminal surfaces the
 * most-recently-finalized sale whose own latest print event is a failure.
 *
 * `print_events` is sale-scoped (no `terminal_id`), so the printer query JOINs
 * to `sales` on the session (tenant, branch, terminal) triple. `drawer_events`
 * carries its own `terminal_id`, which the drawer clear-path uses directly.
 * Drawer-failure projection is computed INDEPENDENTLY of printer-failure so the
 * Slice-4 `<DrawerFailureBanner>` can coexist on screen with
 * `<PrinterFailureBanner>` (Slice 4 decision, Ahmed 2026-05-29; T330 / T361 /
 * NFR-008). The result is a record `{ printer_failure; drawer_failure }`, NOT a
 * single-kind union — a union could only report one banner, silently hiding a
 * concurrent failure of the other class.
 *
 * Drawer CLEAR-PATH (Ahmed 2026-05-30, hardware-recovery): a failed drawer row
 * cannot be superseded on its own sale (UNIQUE(sale_id) + no retry-kick,
 * FR-053), so the drawer banner clears when a LATER `opened` drawer event on the
 * same terminal proves the hardware recovered. See the drawer SELECT below.
 *
 * Correlated `NOT EXISTS` "latest event per sale" form (no window functions —
 * portable to the sql.js test adapter, mirroring the finalize-listener scan).
