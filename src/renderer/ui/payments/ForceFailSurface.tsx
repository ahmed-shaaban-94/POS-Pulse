/**
 * T281 — `<ForceFailSurface>` (Wave 5b-renderer).
 *
 * Manager / admin incident-response surface for force-failing a stuck
 * `started` PaymentAttempt (FR-021 / plan AD-5). Mounted under a
 * manager-only route in `src/renderer/router.tsx`. The route guard is
 * **secondary UX defence only** — the load-bearing role check lives in
 * the main-process bridge handler (`payments-force-fail.ts`). A
 * hostile renderer (e.g., devtools manipulation) bypassing the guard
 * would still be refused at the bridge with `role_denied`.
 *
 * SECURITY (FR-021 last clause):
 *   The manager's identity MUST NEVER be displayed in cashier-visible
 *   UI. This surface IS the manager's view, so displaying the
 *   manager's name here is fine — but no part of the response from
 *   `payments.forceFail` carries the cashier's identity into a
 *   cashier-facing context. The `payments.read` projection (Slice 3c
 *   `projection.ts`) is the FR-017 stripper that prevents
 *   `force_fail_attribution_operator_id` from crossing back to a
 *   cashier surface.
 *
 * FR-017:
 *   No voucher tokens, card data, PII, or operator identity (other
 *   than the signed-in manager's own display name) are rendered.
 *
 * MINIMUM-VIABLE SCOPE (Wave 5b-renderer):
 *   The surface takes a `payment_attempt_id` prop (the caller — a
 *   future "list of stuck attempts" view — supplies the id). The
 *   spec mentions reading a stuck-attempt list via `payments.read`,
 *   but `payments.read` is a single-attempt read; a `payments.listStuck`
 *   bridge method does not yet exist. Recorded as a wave finding for
 *   a future PR.
