/**
 * 006-payments-tender — payment store.
 *
 * Two independent slices:
 *   - **envelope** (Slice 1): the frozen `PaymentIntentEnvelope` received
 *     from CartPane after a successful handoff.
 *   - **paymentSlice** (S3d / T150): a read-only mirror of the
 *     main-process `PaymentAttemptRendererView` projection returned by
 *     `payments.read` / `payments.subscribe`. Components own the bridge
 *     calls and dispatch into the store on each response. The store
 *     does NOT call the bridge itself (AD-1: main owns FSM).
 *
 * SECURITY: The envelope reference is frozen on mount. The payment
 * attempt projection is the renderer-minimised view (FR-017) — voucher
 * tokens, attribution_operator_id, and last_action_id are absent by
 * construction at the main-process projection layer; nothing here can
 * accidentally leak them.
