/**
 * 010-pos-catalog-read-down-consumption — `ReadDownClient` interface (DI seam).
 *
 * The CONCRETE HTTP client (`createReadDownClient`, T020/T021) is BLOCKED on
 * D-DEPLOY (#349): it consumes the generated `api-types.ts` snapshot type, which
 * cannot be re-pinned until the backend serves the deployed contract. Until then
 * the driver (T037/T038) depends only on this INTERFACE — the canonical DI seam —
 * and tests inject a fake. When T021 lands, `createReadDownClient` implements this
 * interface unchanged and the driver wiring (T039) is unaffected.
 *
 * The fetch outcome mirrors the contract's transport-result union
 * (contracts/backend-catalogue-snapshot.md): a reachable+valid snapshot (`ok`), an
 * unreachable backend (`no_connection`), or a reached-but-failed request
 * (`failed`, e.g. non-2xx / malformed body). The raw response body is NEVER
 * surfaced on a failure (P7/NFR-3) — only the discriminator.
