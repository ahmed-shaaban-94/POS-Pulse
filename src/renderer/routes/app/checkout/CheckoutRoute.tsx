/**
 * 006-payments-tender — `/app/checkout` route.
 *
 * When the `payments` feature flag is on, the checkout route renders the live
 * `PaymentSurface` (the tender screen). PaymentSurface self-gates: it returns
 * null unless a signed-in operator session AND a non-null payment envelope
 * exist in the payment store. The envelope is mounted by CartPane's
 * "Continue to payment" handler immediately before navigation here, so by the
 * time this route renders the envelope is present.
 *
 * When the flag is off (fail-closed default), the route falls back to the
 * 003-era `CheckoutPlaceholder` — the visual tender-slot reservation — so the
 * route is never blank and pre-006 behaviour is preserved.
 *
 * PaymentSurface reads its own payments + tender + sales bridge from
 * `window.api`. The one prop threaded here is `onNewSale`: after payment
 * settles, PaymentSurface shows a "New sale" button but is Router-agnostic, so
 * the route owner supplies the post-sale reset+navigate. Resetting the payment
 * and cart stores then returning to /app/cart starts the next sale clean and
 * is what unsticks the cashier from the settled surface (the prior dead-end).
