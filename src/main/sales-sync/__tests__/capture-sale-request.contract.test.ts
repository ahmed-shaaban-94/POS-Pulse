/**
 * capture-sale-request.contract.test.ts — H-1 contract conformance (audit, 2026-06-19).
 *
 * AD-SALE-CAPTURE-1 (Option A, ratified 2026-06-19) authorized adding a contract
 * test "asserting the POS payload passes CaptureSaleRequestSchema." POS has no
 * runtime validator (no zod/ajv on the dep tree, and adding one is a gated
 * package-file edit), so the conformance check is enforced by the TypeScript
 * COMPILER against a vendored, provenance-pinned copy of DP-2's binding contract
 * type (`__contract__/capture-sale-request.contract.ts`, generated from the
 * SHARED `pos-sales/sales.yaml` both sides realize — NOT a hand re-derivation of
 * POS's belief).
 *
 * What this test locks, and what it deliberately leaves to others:
 *   • STRUCTURE (this file, compile-time): every required field present + correctly
 *     typed (the `_toContract` direction), and NO extra keys / no newly-required
 *     field missed (the `_fromContract` direction). This is the `.strict()` /
 *     mass-assignment + missing-required coverage AD-SALE-CAPTURE-1 asked for.
 *   • VALUE-GRAMMAR (elsewhere): the decimal-string grammar (`DecimalAmount`
 *     regex) is unit-tested in `create-sale-sync-client.test.ts`
 *     (`minorUnitsToDecimalString` — exponent 0/2/3); the RFC3339 `occurredAt`
 *     grammar is guaranteed at the source by `index.ts` binding
 *     `now: () => new Date().toISOString()` into finalize-transaction (verified
 *     2026-06-19), which always emits a `.datetime()`-valid `…Z` string. A
 *     runtime spot-check below re-asserts that grammar so this file is not read
 *     as covering only structure.
 *
 * The compiler is the assertion engine: if `toWireBody`'s output type and the
 * vendored contract type ever diverge structurally, this file FAILS TO COMPILE
 * (i.e. the test build breaks) — that is the gate.

// ── Compile-time bidirectional assignability (the contract gate) ───────────────
// `_toContract`: the POS wire body satisfies the DP-2 contract — every required
//   contract field is present and correctly typed. Fails if POS drops/mis-types one.
// `_fromContract`: the DP-2 contract satisfies the POS wire body — POS sends no
//   key the contract forbids, and would break here if the contract added a new
//   required field POS does not yet emit. Together = structural equivalence.
// (Assigned from `null as unknown as T` so the checks are pure type-level and run
//  no code; `void` keeps the linter from flagging them as unused.)
// `_fromContract` widens only `sourceSystem` (WireBody pins the literal
// `'pos-pulse'`; the contract types it `string` — a benign narrowing where POS is
// STRICTER than the contract). Widening it isolates that single field so the
// check still fires on what matters: a NEW required wire key the contract forbids
// (e.g. `tenantId` creeping back) — the mass-assignment regression guard. Type
// assertions use width subtyping (no excess-property check), so this reverse
// direction is the ONLY compile-time guard against a forbidden required key.
