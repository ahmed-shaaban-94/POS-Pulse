/**
 * 010-pos-catalog-read-down-consumption T038 — `read-down-driver`.
 *
 * Orchestrates ONE read-down tick: fetch (injected `ReadDownClient`) → on `ok`,
 * hand the rows to the `ReadDownWriter` (validate → stage → promote, atomic); on
 * a transport failure, record a FAILED attempt WITHOUT touching the writer, so a
 * working catalogue is preserved and the freshness clock never advances on a
 * fetch that did not land (SC-5 / FR-7 at the fetch boundary).
 *
 * ASYNC SINGLE-FLIGHT (FR-12 / FR-14). The real-world background trigger is a
 * `setInterval` (Constitution VIII — paired-terminal background, NOT
 * session-gated), and the cashier-facing `catalogue:refresh` bridge needs a
 * synchronous admission so it can answer `started` / `already_running`
 * IMMEDIATELY without awaiting the read-down (contract Addition 1, "returns
 * immediately after kicking off the tick, not after the promote commits").
 *
 * So admission is split from completion:
 *   • `runTickOnce()` returns SYNCHRONOUSLY — `{ kind: 'started', completed }` for
 *     an admitted tick, or `{ kind: 'already_running' }` when one is in flight.
 *   • The read-down runs on the `completed` promise. The bridge maps on `kind`
 *     and ignores `completed`; the driver's own interval / tests await it.
 *
 * Session refusal is NOT the driver's concern — the background driver isn't
 * session-gated (Constitution VIII); the bridge applies `requireCatalogueSession`
 * (009 gate) before ever calling the driver.
 *
 * The CONCRETE HTTP client is injected (T021, blocked on #349) — the driver
 * depends only on the `ReadDownClient` interface. Scope (`tenantId`/`branchId`)
 * and the clock (`now`) are injected config (the real wiring reads them from
 * `pairingStore` at the composition root, T039); mirrors `finalize-listener`.
